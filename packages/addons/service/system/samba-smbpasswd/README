Addon maintainer: Viljo Viitanen <viljo.viitanen@iki.fi> - openelec forum username viljoviitanen

Default username and password is "openelec", change in addon settings.

During startup insecure system samba is started and after a few seconds
it is killed and the password protected version is started.
If this bothers you, add an user samba config and e.g. remove all shares.

PKG_SHORTDESC="SSNES is a simple frontend for the libsnes library."
PKG_LONGDESC="SSNES is a multi-system emulator for Linux, Windows, Mac OS X and *BSD with roots as a SNES emulator.Its design and background is quite different than most other emulators as SSNES does not implement a SNES emulation core itself. SSNES talks to libsnes, a generic SNES core API made by byuu, author of bSNES. This means that SSNES is core agnostic, and it does not care if you use bSNES, SNES9x or any implementation of libsnes at all. It can even work with completely different systems if you're adventurous enough. libsnes has been extended to work well with other similar systems."

Note: MAME is not gpl software and has its own license

The addon doesn't build automatically. Compile MAME first manually from source with native on host
(32- or 64-bit), first applying the patch included which removes gnome and xinerama references.
After that build mame addon for the architecture you built native mame for. To build 32-bit mame on
64-bit host, you need to create e.g. a 32-bit chroot environment.

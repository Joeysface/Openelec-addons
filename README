Hack to get mysql server service addon in OpenELEC.

How to use: first check out openelec git repository

Then copy this repo contents over there, it creates

packages/addons/service/system/mysql-server

then run 
./scripts/create_addon mysql-server

For now this messes up the build system so after making the addon
you need to clean up at least the mysql build dir.


(This is intentionally not a forked openelec repo!)
